#  RoutineChecks
  
  
 Routine App Skeleton Built  with the MVVM Architecture and repository pattern.  

Written in Kotlin and makes use of modern language features like Coroutines and  Extensions.

**Also Includes** :
- Cool Stuff like Navigation Components for Deep Linking and Navigation
- Dagger 2 for Dependency Injection
- DB layer with Room ORM.
  
 
  
Not so interesting at the moment. Time constraint (phew)
  
## Overview

 - Create, Read and Update for **Routines**
 - Lifetime of  a Routine is 15 minutes for this skeleton. Flesh can be added in the future??
 - Nextup Feature for all events within 12 hours
 - Adherence to routines performance.

## ToDo

- Improve Unit Testing 
- Add Flesh to Application
- Setup Server and Build APIS to "routinely" sync local DB.
